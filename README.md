# 🌲 Wildfire Emergency Aid & Relief Fund

A decentralized, transparent, and secure platform powered by **Solana** to facilitate emergency donations and rapid relief for wildfire-affected communities.

## 🚀 Overview

Wildfires are becoming increasingly severe, displacing families and straining emergency resources. This project provides a blockchain-based solution for fast, transparent, and trustworthy donation processing. Our goal is to directly connect donors with verified relief organizations using the power of Web3.

## 🧩 Features

- 🔒 **Solana-Powered Smart Contracts**  
  Fast, low-cost, and scalable transactions.

- ✅ **Verified Relief Organizations**  
  Only pre-approved entities can request or withdraw funds.

- 📊 **Real-Time Donation Tracking**  
  Every transaction is recorded on the blockchain for transparency.

- 🧾 **Automated Receipts**  
  Donors receive on-chain confirmations for each contribution.

- ⚙️ **Future: Smart Allocation System**  
  Use AI to prioritize fund disbursement based on severity and impact.

## 💡 How It Works

1. Donors connect their wallets and contribute SOL or stablecoins.
2. Smart contracts lock the funds until requests are verified.
3. Verified organizations request funds for specific needs.
4. Smart contracts release funds directly to the organization’s wallet.
5. All transactions are immutable and viewable on-chain.
